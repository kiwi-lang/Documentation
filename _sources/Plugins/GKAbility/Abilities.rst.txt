=========

Relevant classes:

* :class:`UGKGameplayAbility`: basic Gameplay Ability for skills and items, implements a few top down casting options
* :class:`FGKAbilityStatic`: configurable settings for abilities
* :class:`AGKAbilityTarget_Actor`: used to select a target for a given ability

* :class:`UGKAttributeSet`: defines a set of attributes for characters (Health, Mana, Stamina, etc...)
* :class:`UGKAbilityWidget`: defines a basic interface for widget representing an ability state

Features
--------

* **Data-Driven**: Ability can generate their own GameplayEffect at runtime
* **Generic**: Ability does not assume a specific Character/Skeleton
* **Multiplayer ready**
* **Basic UI**: easier debugging


Get Started
-----------

Setup
^^^^^

#. Create inputs use an EnhancedInputContext
	* Gamekit provided a few predefine action you can reuse including `ConfirmTarget` & `CancelTarget` input/Action

#. Create a new enum with the same action/input names (see :cpp:enum:`EGK_MOBA_AbilityInputID` as an example)

#. Create a Character from :cpp:class:`GKCharacterBase`

#. Extend the On Setup Player Input Component event, use to register your input to the ability system component
   (See :cpp:func:`AGKCharacterBase::BindAbilityActivationFromInputEnum`)

   .. warning::

	  :cpp:member:`FGKGameplayAbilityInputBinds::CancelCommand` and :cpp:member:`FGKGameplayAbilityInputBinds::ConfirmCommand`
	  are the named defined in the input's project setting NOT the enum name.


#. You are ready to grant abilities using :cpp:func:`AGKCharacterBase::GrantAbility`
   In Gamekit abilities are granted to a character for a given slot, each ability populates a slot.
   Slots can then be assigned an input. Gamekit defines 22 default slots (6 Skills, 8 Items, 7 Basic Abilities).
   Under the hood slots are simple integer, users can add as many slots as they want.

   .. note::

	  Granting ablities can only be done by the authority

#. During Gameplay, you can press inputs and the abilities will activate.

Creating Abilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Create a new DataTable using the `GKAbilityStatic` struct

* Insert a row, give the row a name (the row name is used to generate the ability asset)

* Click the generate button

.. warning::

   Python Editor Scripting plugin needs to be enabled & configured


GameTags
--------

Gametags are used to mark the current state of a player/ability/effect, it is used to control
transition between different states. It is the core of the gameplay ability system, some effects
are exclusively implemented through gameplaytags.

For example, Stun, Silences, Roots are all gameplay effects that simply prevent the character
from using certain abilities, they can all be implemented using gameplaytag alone.

Gamekit automatically defines base gametags for its abilities.

* Ability: use to tag abilities
	* Exclusive: Used to prevent activation of multiple abilities witht the `Exclusive` tag
	* Move: Used to tag abilities performing movement operation
	* Passive: tag passive abilities

* Animation: used to tag animation
	* CastPoint: Tag is sent when the animation reach the point where projectile/effect should be
	  spawned.

* Cooldown: used to tag cooldowns
	* Prevents the same ability from being casted all the time

* Buff: Improves the effectiveness of a character
	* Immunity: protects against debuff and disables
	* Armor increase
	* Damage
	* Health bonus
	* Haste: increase movement speed
	* Level: level of the buff
		* Minor

* Debuff: reduce the effectiveness of a character
	* Level: level of the debuff

	* Level: level of the disable
		* Minor
		* Medium
		* Strong
	* Stun: prevents movement, spell casting and item usage
	* Silence: prevents spell casting
	* Mute: prevent item usage
	* Root: prevent all movements
	* Break: disable passive abilities
	* Dead: removes all buffs, debuffs and disables
		* Death is both a disable and a dispel, on depth all active effects are removed
		  but all actions are disabled.
	* Etheral: cannot do physical damage, cannot be damaged by physical attacks [TODO]
	* Disarmed: cannot do physical attacks [TODO]

	* Network: Internal error due to networking
	* NotLearned: Ability was not learned yet

	* Immunity

	* Silence
	* Mute
	* Root
	* Break

* Quest: used to tag objectives for the quest system

Creating GameplayEffect
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* For simple gameplay effect that modify attributes you should configure the magniture to be set by caller
  using the tag "Ability.Magnitude". By default, `UGKGameplayAbility` will populate the data from the `FGKAbilityStatic` data.


Define Abilities
----------------

Abilities are define inside a json file.
The list of customizable properties can be found here :class:`FGKAbilityStatic`.
Gameplay designer can create new abilities by simply adding new abilities inside the ability data file.
To create the new abilities in unreal engine you need to generate them using a python script.

#. Enable python scripting for UnrealEngine
#. Add ``Gamekit/Script`` to your python path
#. Go to ``Gamekit/Content/Editor/Ability_Generator`` right click on it and ``Run Editor Utility Widget``.
   A widget should pop up with a bit "Generate Default Abilities" button
#. Click on the button, this will generate all the missing abilities

Animations
^^^^^^^^^^

To make abilities generic, the animations montage themselves are not specified.
Instead an animation kind is set (Channelling, Attack, Cast, etc..) which is a single enumerator
:cpp:enumerator:`EGK_AbilityAnimation` representing the kind of annimation an ability can use.

The animation montage are specified by the Character itself through its :cpp:class:`FGKAnimationSet` (inside :cpp:class:`FGKUnitStatic`)
which our ability can sample from.

When an ability is activated the :cpp:class:`FGKAnimationSet` is fectched from the character to the ability
and the right animation is then played. This enable us to use the same ability for different
characters which can have different animation as well.

User Interface
--------------

Spell Button States
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See :class:`UGKAbilityWidget` for a basic set of implementable event

Here is a list of states you might want to consider when implementing
a spell button.

#. Ability is available and can be casted (UMG State Normal)

#. Ability is picking a target

#. Ability is being cast (Animation)

#. Ability is on cooldown

#. Backswing animation

#. Ability requirements/cost are not met

#. Ability cannot be cast because of debuff

UI & Ability State
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The easiest way to bind the ability is to leverage the ``UGKAbilityWidget`` coupled with ``UGKAbilitySystemEventManager``.

#. Instantiate a new ``UGKAbilitySystemEventManager``, call ``SetupDelegates`` to start listenning to events from the ``UAbilitySystemComponent``

#. Register ``UGKAbilityWidget`` to the event manager using ``AddAbilityWidget`` then ``SetupAbilityWidgetDelegates`` to start receiving events.


.. note::

	``AddAbilityWidget`` expects an interger as ID, by default it uses ``FGameplayAbilitySpec.InputID``.
	The behaviour can be overiden by implementing ``GetWidgetIDFromAbilitySpecHandle`` and ``GetWidgetIDFromAbilitySpec``.

	Currently ``InputID`` was used over ``FGameplayAbilitySpecHandle`` because it allows us to create Ability widget before the
	ability is even granted.
