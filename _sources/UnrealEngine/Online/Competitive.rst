Competitive
===========

* Small number of players on a single instance (10-100)
* Teams of players (2-10)
* Game instance is short lived (20-60 minutes)
* Players are grouped by skill to provide interesting matches (i.e no stomp)
* Map/Level is small (all assets are loaded, no streaming)
* Latency is critical (10-100ms) (< 50ms LAN, < 100 ms Ranked)

  * 30 FPS is one frame every 30 ms

* Avoid latency spikes at all cost

System Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image :: /_static/Competitive/CompetitiveOverview.png

#. Client start matchaming by sending a matchmaking request to the game coordinator
#. Game coordinator group players of similar skill into teams
#. Game coordinator find an empty server instance
#. Game coordinator create a session on the server instance
#. Game coordinator reply to clients with the only session to join
#. Client join the online session
#. Dedicated server update player stats

The game coordinator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image :: /_static/ranked/SkilDistribution.png

Its goal is to group players with similar skill, to provide interesting games;
To group players it needs first to estimate skill of each players using a rating system.

Its secondary goal is to load balance session on different instances.
Typically servers will be able to handle multiple instance of a dedicated server,
but spliting the load accross many servers will improve the experience (lower latency).


Ranking Systems
---------------

Goals:

* Put players of similar skills together to create interesting matches
* Avoid low quality match (stomps)
* https://github.com/Delaunay/Ranked


Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Give new players a fixed amount of points

Simple, high skill player will need to grind/win a lot to move to their skill bracket (which might become boring too quickly).
Low skill player will lose a lot which will be boring/annoying.
You can tweak the ranking algorithm to make larger updates at the beginning.

.. note::

   If new games have enough mechanic to learn the win/lose streak might not be too bad as people
   used those to learn how to play the game.


#. Do a binary search

   * Make new players take 10 calibration match
   * Starts at a medium Level
   * If loss try lower rank
   * If high try higher rank

.. note::

   Binary search allow us to quickly find the rank a player is by
   jumping divisions without going through standard ranking updates,
   but the estimate is noisy so player can lose/win games due to external factors.
   We can reduce the binary search range to avoid jumping too far.

#. Regression model; if match data is available a regression model can be implemented
   to estimate the rank from match data ``NetWorth * a + Damage * b + Death * c + Kills * d + Assist * e + Hero * f = Rank``

.. note::

   Regression models requires a fair amount of data before it can be implemented, as such it is not a valid approach for
   boostraping a new game.


Elo Systems
+++++++++++

.. note::

   This system is considered outdated


Updates
*******

.. code-block::

   pi ~ N(ui, s ** 2)  # Performance is normally distributed around their skill

   Probbility of winning is:

      P(p1 > p2 | u1, u2) = CDF((s1 - s2) / sqrt(2 * s))

   On match result y (1, 0, -1) for win, draw, loss, score is updated as

      K = alpha * s * sqrt(pi)

      delta = K * ((y + 1) / 2 - CDF((s1 - s2) / sqrt(2 * s)))

      s1 = s1 + y * delta
      s2 = s2 - y * delta

   where alpha is a weighting factor, which is often summerized as K

   The normal distribution can be substituted by the logistic distribution which
   has a easier cdf than the normal distribution.


For chess;

.. code-block::

   R(new) = R(old) = K * (W - We)

   We = 1 / (1 + 10 ^ ((R - OR) / 400))
   We = Q / (Q + QO)

   Q  = 10 ^ (R / 400)
   QO = 10 ^ (RO / 400)

   R: Rating
   OR: Oponents Rating
   C: 200
   K: 32
   W: Actual Result (1 for win, 0 for loss)
   We: Expected result
   K: 32

``K`` is a constant that can be tweaked, it sets the maximum adjustmnent
per game i.e the rating can at most increase/decrease by ``K``.
``K`` is critical to the algorithm.
If too low the score will not adapt fast enough, if too high the score will
be too volatile.

You can use a layered approach where ``K`` gets smaller has the
rank increase, so high skill player will quickly climb the ladder
to the high skill stage.


Issues
******

* Inflation/Deflation: Elo has a fixed amount of points in its pool (win-loss) is a zero sum game so inflation/deflation should not happen
   * New players add new points in the Elo pool (inflation)
   * Old players retired and remove points from the Elo pool (deflation)

* Player can stop playing to protected their rating,
   or cause them to create alternate accounts.


Glicko-2
++++++++

The `paper <http://www.glicko.net/glicko/glicko2.pdf>`_ goes in great details how to implement such a ranking system.


Initialization
**************

* Starts with calibration matches (n=~10)
* Unrated player starts with

  .. code-block::

     # Starting values, Glicko-1 Scale
     r = 1500
     rd = 350
     s = 0.06  # Tweakable

     ## Glicko-2 Scale
     # Rating location
     mu = (r - 1500) / 173.7178

     # Rating deviation
     phi = RD / 173.7178


TrueSkill Like
++++++++++++++

Baysian Generative Model for skill

* Takes into account teams, so performance is function of the teammates permutation

* `TrueSkill <https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2006/file/f44ee263952e65b3610b8ba51229d1f9-Paper.pdf>`_

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_graph


.. code-block::

   Skill ~ N(mu, sigma)  # Skill inside the game
                         # sigma models the consistency of the player
                         # To infer

   Perf ~ N(s, Beta)     # Performance for a specific match
                         # with Beta modeling the randomness inherent to the game
                         # Observed

   Team ~ Sum(Perf for each Teammate)  # Performance of the team
                                       # Observed

   Rank = (Team_i - Team_(i - 1))      # Rank
                                       # Observed

.. code-block::

   Posterior distribution (assumed to be gaussian):

      p(s | r, A) = P(r | s, A) P(s) / P(r | A)

   r: Team rank from {1 ... k} (r == in case of draws)
   A: Team assignment from {1 ... n}
   k: Number of Teams
   n: Number of Players


      p(s) = prod({1 ... n}, N(s_i, mu_i, sigma_i ^ 2))


   Player performance is

      p_i ~ N(p_i; s_i, Beta^2)

   Team performance is the sum of the players performance

      t_j = sum(i in A_j, p_i)

   Reorder teams in ascending order of rank

   Probability of a game rank r

      P(r | {t_1 ... t_k}) = P(t_r1 > t_r2 > ... > t_rk)

   The training needs to be online (i.e realtime player skill update)

   * Gaussian density filtering
   * message-passing
   * sum-product algorithm
   * Expectation propagation


Concerns
--------

* Alternate accounts; as the score of player increase match becomes fair
  Some player will be actively looking for easier matches by creating
  alternative accounts to lower their rank.

* Toxicity: It is not recommended to display the exact rating number
  as it can cause players to obsses too much on their rating.
  A discrete rank/division system provides an overall rating, which
  might help the players focus on getting out of their devision instead of
  focusing on +/- of their ratings.
  Note, that toxicity will still happen at the entrance of each division
  as players can feel like they need to win to stay in their division.

   * Behaviour score which decrease in function of teammate reports
     pair toxic players with each other.

* Player can stop playing to protected their rating;
  The game can implement seasons which will reset the ranking every year.

* Rank inflation/deflation; season system can alleviate the effect

* Account buying; restrictions on the account that can enter ranked matchmaking
  will reduce the number of account sold

   * Restrictions

      * Force account verification through a phone number
      * Require a minimum play time before enabling ranked

   * Attack the account black market

      * Sell booster kits that allow players to play in lower/higher ranks for a limited number of games.
        Booster are cheaper than boosted accounts (which reduce the appeal of boosted accounts),
        reduces the amount of games ruined by account buyers.
        Additionally boosted players are known by the matchmaking server, it can balance teams to reduce the skill gap.
        Increase the K factor (or similar) to allow players to switch division if they do win.
        Players might pay for account boosting because they might feel stuck in `Elo Hell <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_hell>`_
        While its existence is still debated, the booster kit could help them skip over it (if it does in fact exist),
        burst their bubble, they could also use the opportunity to learn.
        In fact boosted player will have a bad reputation from the get go it might help to reframe boosted player as
        students/apprentice and promote the community to be teachers.

* Party queuing, friends queuing together have a greater skill than
  a simple sum of their solo skills.


Team Assignment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The game mode is in charge of the team assignment, teams need to be assigned to Pawn (for targeting)
and PlayerControllers. PlayerController team assignment will drive all the logic.
The team assignment needs to be on both the pawn & the controller for effect like Possession
(i.e enemy player taking control of an ally unit.

Tha player controller factions cannot change during gameplay (but its attitude towards other faction could change)
Pawns' faction could change as part of regular gameplay interaction.

* Assigned using :cpp:class:`AGKTeamPlayerStart` simple method the player start is selected at random
  by the :cpp:class:`AGameMode`; it extract the team from the player start and assign it
  to the pawn.

* Assigned by the matchmaker: optimal for balanced games, so teams skill can be as close
  as possible
