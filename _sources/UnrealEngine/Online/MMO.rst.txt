Massively Multiplayer
=====================

* Huge number of players on a single instance (200-1000)
* Game instance is long-lived (24h/7)
* Map/Level is big (levels are streamed seamlessly)
* Latency is not too critical (100-200ms)

  * PvP will prefer lower latency
  * PvE is manageable with higer latency


.. note::

   MMO will often provide competitive sub-games (battleground)
   which will have different requirements.
